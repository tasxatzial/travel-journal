# Travel Journal

A simple static page built with React.

This is a solo project from the React basics module of the [Frontend Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend) course on [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com).

## Implementation

* Responsive.
* Accessible + screen reader friendly.
* Mobile first approach.

Since I've had access to the Figma file, I've tried to match the design as closely as possible. However, I decided to adjust some elements based on what I considered to be the best approach. Specifically:

* The text contrast of the Google Maps URL was too low, so it has been increased.
* The font sizes were quite small, so they were scaled to 150%.
* Both columns of each post are aligned to the top instead of the center, creating a more consistent look and feel.
